Root Cause :Failure in the administration and application of the Permit to Work System.",HiPo Incident,601"The incident occurred while the injured person was tightening a leaking connection on a mud pump, middle piston rod lubricating system. The injured person used an adjustable wrench on the leaking connection and he placed his left hand down to brace himself while applying force. His foot slipped off the chain case and lube oil pump as he exerted force on the wrench. This caused his left hand to slip, from where it was anchored, down into the right piston coffin where it got caught between the moving pony rod/piston clamp and the face of the liner and was struck once before he pulled his hand out.",HiPo Incident,602"A drillship was laying out 13-3/8"" casing onto the Forward Pipe Catwalk during drilling operations. A joint of casing was remotely landed on the mobile bucket using the tubular handling facility. The retaining arm was released and the operator then retracted the luffing arm. He then activated the roller park facility before the luffing arm was fully retracted, which resulted in the luffing arm moving upwards. The steel rod on the side of the luffing arm glanced the casing enough to push it out of the bucket and over the side of the catwalk. The casing joint swung uncontrolled towards the well centre. ",HiPo Incident,608"During the skidding-in of the rig cantilever, a floorman was standing at the end of the rig main deck, guiding a cement hose with a rope. The cement hose was lifted up using an air winch in order for it to pass clear of the main deck hand rail (one hand rail was removed to facilitate easy passing of the cement hose). The cement hose was entangled with a bracket at the skidding beam, compressing it, and then suddenly it became free - causing spring movement which pushed the floorman overboard. The floorman, who was wearing a work vest, was recovered safely and checked by rig medic and found in good health.",HiPo Incident,612"An incident occurred during the launching of the Bengal Producer.   The Bengal Producer was tasked to pick up two Sangu employees from the Sangu Alpha platform on completion of their work day. During routine launching of the craft, an upset condition occurred which caused (three) members of the crew manning the Bengal Producer to enter the water as man overboard (MOB).  2 crew were recovered immediately closeby vessel, the 3rd crew member was swept away in 4-5 knot current, heading SSW ,and later rescued by a local fishing vessel and transferred to the OSV.

As the supervisor was engaged in welding activities (pipeline tie-in), he could not convoy the trailer during performance of a right turn and the driver failed to choose a correct radius and the trailer's right side wheel fell to below the road level.  Under the impact of its own weight (estimated 33 tones) the backhoe slid off the trailer and fell onto the ground. The 4 chains used to secure the backhoe from 4 sides on the trailer were torn. The trailer itself did not turn over.",HiPo Incident,615"The operation was washing in the hole with coiled tubing utilising 9.5ppg brine taking returns to the well test spread surge tank. Due to the fluid level in the left hand surge tank compartment, the well test company's operators intention was to switch to the right hand compartment. They should have opened the right hand valve first and then closed the left hand valve to avoid deadheading the system. However, they closed the left hand valve before opening the right hand valve.  This resulted in a system pressure increase and the pressure relief valve lifted discharging  brine into the sea via the relief line.",HiPo Incident,616"A worker was engaged in cable work activities at ground level of an LNG Tank.  At the same time insulation work was ongoing at an elevation on the same location and its work access provided by scaffold erected from the ground to the full height of the tank (approx. 36 metres).

The employees were using a high voltage searchlight, which was not an explosion proof product, inside the vessel during the release. The workers noticed strange and bad smells. The sub-contractor did not inform the customer about the smells and the usage of the light. One of them came up from the vessel to take a fresh air respirator in order to continue his work inside.  10-15 minutes after his return an explosion occurred inside the vessel. The workers were harmed by the heat and suffered burn injuries.",HiPo Incident,653"The drill string of 3-1/2'' DP was composed of two types of DP the G 105 and S 135. When pulling out of hole and laying down joints, G 105 were laid down first with no problem. A first joint of S 135 came out and was positionned in the V-door. The driller asked the roughnecks to reposition the S 135 in order to separate G 105 from S 135. To do this, a roughneck stands at the tugger to elevate the DP and the other stands by to control and reposition the DP. An incorrect elevator was used, the ID of the same was bigger then the OD of DP's tool joint and the pipe was free to slide; at this point the elevator came free hitting the roughneck in the face.",HiPo Incident,657"A gasket leak was found on the dehydration regeneration circuit.  During a routine check, a gas leak was detected.  On investigation a gas leak was discovered at the downstream side of the non return valve on the dehydration regeneration line.  A Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) check was immediately carried out and this confirmed an LEL reading of 60% approximately 10 metres downwind of the leak.  This was reported to the Central Control Room (CCR) and Shift Superintendent.  A second visit was then carried out with the Shift Superintendent and discovered the leak had ceased due to increased regeneration temperature expanding the pipe work thus stopping the flow.",HiPo Incident,666"A field specialist was performing an injectivity test for a well. Coiled Tubing (CT) reel had to be spotted on the I-beam which was 1.5m above the deck floor. To get a clearer view for spooling, the field specialist had to stand on top of a container which was 2.45 m above deck level to give a signal to the Coiled Tubing operator inside control cabin.

The requirements for working in heights and work preparations for cold work were not sufficiently addressed in the procedures.",HiPo Incident,686"An explosion occurred at the construction site resulting in 4 instant deaths and 17 injured 4 of them with serious injury, one of them dying the day after. After investigation, it was found that the construction team was storing gas cylinders (oxygen &amp; acetylene) in a container every evening. In order to avoid theft of the equipment at night, the worker would tag weld the doors of the container. The accident occurred when the workers were in the process of grinding the welds to open the doors. No bottle was found exploded, and we can assume that an accumulation of acetylene from a leaking cylinder was ignited by the sparks of the grinding machine used for breaking the welds.",Fatal Incident,687"A 10 tonne truck crane was used to lift a bar bending yard to a tankage construction area. The lifting work was monitored by an area HSE Promoter. After the rebar was loaded onto the truck crane, the operator went down to the outrigger control point to retract the outrigger. The rigger climbed out and stood on the right extended rear side to set and push some protruding rebars into the crane bucket. While the operator on duty retracted the rear side of the outrigger, he heard the rigger scream. The job was immediately stopped.

The crew had completed their work for the day and were in the dog house changing their clothes.  When the crew remembered that they needed to fully open a surface casing valve to relieve pressure on the casing, one employee who had already changed out of his work clothes went alone to open the valve.  Although no other employees witnessed the accident, it is believed that when the employee opened the ball valve, the blow down line whipped across the location and struck him simultaneously in both legs. His legs were broken and subsequently both legs had to be amputated. The employee also sustained a fracture of the right shoulder scapula.",HiPo Incident,701"After performing a flow check on a wiper trip, the driller ran the blocks up the derrick for another stand.  The derrickman had been sitting in the heated shelter (-30 degrees C working conditions) during the flow check.  The derrickman exited the shelter and communicated that he was ready, however he had removed the lateral restraint line while in the shelter and failed to re-attach prior to beginning work.  He grabbed the stand and proceded to throw it in the elevators.  Expecting the support of the lateral restraint, the worker lost his balance and fell into the elevators.  The worker was wearing his full harness and fall arrest line, which engaged.

At approximately six feet above the deck, the load suddenly swung due to the motion of the rig, and the end of the bundle collided with an adjacent oxy-acetylene cylinder rack frame. The cylinder rack was knocked over onto the gantry crane track and came to rest. This caused three of the six cylinders within the rack to dislodge from the rack and they came to rest adjacent to the rack. The three cylinders which became dislodged had caps protecting the valves, however two of the other cylinders did not. The closest observer was approximately 8ft away from the rack at the time of incident.",HiPo Incident,722"At approx 2:30 pm both waterflood turbines went down apparently due to high flow or overspeed.  Several operators went to investigate and discovered an underground leak near the lateral isolation valves.  They put on air packs and attempted to close the isolation valves.  The catwalk was inaccessible due to hot water spray, so the operators walked on the east lateral to reach the valves.  An operator slipped and fell on the ground in several inches of hot water, burning his left side.  The operator was carried to the waterflood control room for first aid.  Several minutes later the 10inch underground 'jumper' line connecting the east and south laterals ruptured, creating a large hole and releasing produced water.",HiPo Incident,722"Contractor crew were loading a tubing elevator into a metal storage box at the main deck using the port side crane. The box cover could not be secured in the open position using the support bar due to the unit being in close proximity. The victim was holding back the box cover and resting his left hand on the edge of the box. After the load was released, the signal man signaled to the crane perator to pick up the block. While the crane block was being picked up, the sling thimble hung up on the box edge and the cover fell down into the closed position on the victim's left thumb.

While traveling down the hill to the retaining wall site, the truck's front wheel sank into a soft spot on the edge of the road. The driver had a couple of workers fill in the soft spot with rocks and then the truck proceeded to drive down the hill. As the truck's rear wheel went through the soft spot, the wheel sunk due to the weight of the concrete beams, and tipped the back of the truck causing some of the concrete beams to fall. One of the workers who had placed the rocks in the soft spot was struck by and pinned between the beams and the soft hillside. The beams were lifted off the worker and he was taken to the hospital. Injured person suffered multiple fractures.",HiPo Incident,760"During the off-loading of containers from the supply boat to the offshore platform, the first officer was directing the operation, but located in a blind spot.  As the lifting began, the first officer was trapped by a guide rope hanging from the container with a loop at the end, and was dragged against the bannister of the boat. The crew was unable to release him and they had to open the bannister letting the man fall into the water, since the vessel was moving away from the platform. The crew threw him a life buoy and launched the life boat. Thirty minutes after falling into the water, the rescue team managed to cut the rope and move him onboard the platform for medical attention and helicopter evacuation. The officer suffered multiple leg fractures.",HiPo Incident,761"On attempting to start a compressor, it was found that it failed. The problem was discussed and it was concluded that it could be down to the circuit breaker which had given rise to similar probems in the past. The circuit breaker (13.5kV) was racked out of position and the start relay operation observed and seen to be working correctly. The circuit breaker was then racked back into postion. However, the breaker was in the closed position and should have been prevented from being racked into postion by electrical and mechanical interlocks. These failed to operate and the result was and explostion within the circuit breaker cubicle which destroyed the breaker and caused some minor burns on one of the electrical technicians. Could have been 2 fatalities.",HiPo Incident,762"After completing the bottom hole flowing pressure survey (BHFP), a dummy valve was run and got stuck at 100 ft. and lost its jar action.  After unsuccessful attempts to release the stuck dummy valve, it was decided to drop the cutter to cut the wire above the tool string.  While preparing for the above operations, the cross over connecting the lubricator with x-mass tree cap slipped off, leading to an uncontrolled pressure release to the atmosphere.  The helper who was standing on the wellhead platform near by the cross over was blasted in the face by well pressure before he jumped to the ground to escape. The supervisor on site immediately closed the swab valve and kept the well under control.  The injured person was evacuated to the hospital by ambulance.",HiPo Incident,767"While transporting 2 pipes a contractor trailer was being towed by a bulldozer with a steel rope. At a distance of 100 m from the bottom of the hill, the tow rope of the tandem-axle semitrailer suddenly broke away  because of a sudden jerk of the trailer by the bulldozer. Thus two pipes and the semitrailer rolled back down to the bottom of the hill. There was damage to the pipes and the semitrailer body only. The SWL of the rope was 18t, the total weight of the pipes 15t. The total weight of the tandem-axle semitrailer body was 1.5t. But the rope's clips did not withstand the weight of the load and the rope slipped out of the clips. The clips were not tightened properly before the work. That was not checked by either the driver or mechanics before the trip.",HiPo Incident,767"While a contractor was carrying out mechanical excavation, 5 fiber optic communication cables were cut. Due to the cut, all communication between the Central Degassing Station (CDS) and five Remote Degassing Stations (RDS) was lost and all RDSs were shutdown resulting in loss of production volume approximately 30,000 bbls.  Two production trains were also shut down at CDS.  Due to the shut down at RDS No. 5, high pressure developed in a flowline from Bb-300 causing flowline rupture, resulting in estimated spillage of 37 bbls of crude oil into the ground and release of gases into the air.  Bb-304 flowline also developed a pinhole leak. The Remote Degassing Stations started back and wells no. Bb-300 &amp; 304 were closed and flowlines were isolated for repair.",HiPo Incident,768"Backfilling of excavated trench of a 12"" gas pipeline with sand was in progress with the help of a Tipper Truck in the field. During this operation, the driver of the Tipper Truck took the vehicle in reverse direction close to the excavated site and unloaded the sand directly from the tipper truck to excavated trench. After this operation, the driver forgot to reset the tipper body to its original position and took forward the vehicle in the same condition. In the process he also ignored watching the 11 KV overhead electrical transmission lines which are just above the site.  As a result, the front portion of the Tipper which was in elevated position hit with the electrical high voltage transmission line.  Fortunately nothing happened. No Injuries. No damages.",HiPo Incident,770"Steam Turbine Alternator Catastrophic Failure. The fracture and drop out of an internal bracing bar in the fan housing caused the No. 1 steam turbine fan to break up.  This shattered the gearbox pinion bearings and stripping of the turbine coupling bolts.   The coupling parted, and the tails of the coupling bolts were bent up into the open coupling faces. The physical damage caused variation in oil pressure which allowed the governor valves to open, probably fully, to try to restore turbine speed to the set point.  The effect of the steam flow into the turbine, which was disconnected from the gearbox etc, caused massive turbine acceleration.  In turn this led to centrifugal loss turbine blades, causing imbalance and bending of the shaft leading to its failure.",HiPo Incident,770"While flowing well to the test separator and diverting produced water to filtration vessel for filtration, a vessel hatch cover came loose sending produced water and the cover into the air. The cover measured 13.75•À_•À_ x 17.65•À_•À_ and weighed approximately 15 lbs. After traveling an estimated 25•À_ in the air, it landed several feet away from the filtration unit on the top deck. Although personnel were in the area of the unit, no injuries occurred and all the liquid was contained by secondary containment. The equipment was immediately shutdown, the carbon vessel was taken out of service and the area was secured. A facility investigation was completed the following day and the team determined the filter and cover had not been properly installed at the fabrication yard.",HiPo Incident,773"The involved person (IP) was part of a work team on night shift for external fence erection. The shift started at 21.00 hrs. The IP wandered outside of the work area without informing either his supervisor or his colleagues. This was shortly after arrival at the worksite. At the end of the shift it was noticed that he was missing but assumed that he had gone back to the camp. Upon arriving at the camp a search was initiated with no results. The morning shift arrived at 0500 and found a person lying badly injured at the bottom of a cliff near the work area. The IP was found and medics mobilised. He stabilised and medevaced to the nearest hospital by road. It was later discovered that a tree had broken the IP's fall, although he still sustained severe head injuries.",HiPo Incident,774"Casing was being racked in stands in the derrick using the offline work station and Pipe Racking System (PRS). The 41st stand was racked in the fingers and the latch (restraining device) was observed to be down. The PRS was then retracted to collect the next stand. Shortly afterwards, stand 41 fell across the derrick and lodged precariously on the end forward casing finger. The drill floor was cleared of personnel and a plan was devised to recover the stand of casing using an air tugger. During the recovery attempt, the casing fell to port and landed on the port crane (boom wire) where it bounced and the top joint (45ft of casing) fell overboard into the sea. The other 2 joints of casing came to rest on the end of the crane boom with the lower end on the drill floor.",HiPo Incident,777"A Contractor Company crew was performing workover of the well pad. At 16:30 when pulling out of the hole with NV-32 pump, making up of an adjusting semi-rod on the polished rod resulted in sponateous movement of fully unloaded rod string downwards. This resulted in squeezing of the right hand of a senior operator between the sucker-rod tongs and the guide nipple. The casualty was rendered first pre-doctor aid, an ambulance was called in, the casualty was transported to the city hospital. The diagnosis: open fracture and displacement of the base of the main phalanx on the right hand finger 1, subcapital fracture of the main phalanx on the right hand finger 1, open fracture of nail phalanx on the right hand finger 1, avulsive wounds on the back surface of the right hand.",HiPo Incident,779"Workers were found to have removed an earthing resistor without having a permit to work or any authorization to enter the transformer area. The earthing resister was connected to the live 33kV busbar at substation #3. This area was clearly defined by CSU orange fencing and warning tape. The cable connecting the 33kV switchboard transformer resistor had been disconnected from earth at the secondary side of the transformer, thus leaving the 33kV switchboard without earth fault protection, as the alternative earthing transformer to the 33KV switchboard had been isolated. This situation could have been potentially lethal to any one in the area if a fault had occurred whilst the earthing resistor was disconnected. Work was stopped and workmen were pulled out from work site.",HiPo Incident,779"At 10:45 am a complete power shutdown was initiated, following the activation of an ESD push button located at a lifeboat station. As a consequence the rig was left with no power generation, no Uninterrupted Power System (UPS) and then with no possibility to maintain and monitor her position above the well. The yellow alert was raised shortly followed by the red alert. The Emergency Disconnect Sequence (EDS) was therefore initiated by the Driller, shearing the completion string and disconnecting the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP). The drillship started drifting until it was maintained in position by 2 tugboats (about 2 NM away from well location). ERC (Emergency Response Centre) was locally activated. On the drillship, dynamic positioning functions were restored at 7 pm.",HiPo Incident,784"When starting gas injection in a converted well, three consecutive gas leaks occurred on the modified equipment. The last one led to automatic shut down. It was initiated by gas detector indications of 90 % and 105 % LEL. The first leak was due to an open pipe end in a bleed line to the flare. The second one was caused by a valve wrongly mounted in back-seat position with subsequent damage to gaskets. The third leak came from a flange where the bolt nuts had been tightened with an insufficient torque. Among main causes: Modified equipment was accepted for operation without being properly checked out. Mechanical completion had not been verified and no leak testing had been done _•À_•À_ There had been insufficient management follow-up of this one and a half year modification project.",HiPo Incident,788"An explosion occurred in an oily water drain sump during hot work to extend the height of the atmospheric vent line. The sump and drain system had recently been tied into an existing online oily drainage system. A detailed investigation determined that the isolation plug fitted in the oily drain system was not of the correct specification to prevent the migration of hydrocarbon vapours into the hot work site. Gas testing was not conducted immediately prior to commencement of welding, and the sample tube used was not of sufficient length to sample the bottom of the sump. Recommendations from the investigation included the need for a Job Hazard Analysis to be performed and a review of isolation standards to ensure that stopple plugs of the correct specifications are used in future.",HiPo Incident,790"The supply vessel was snatching deck cargo at the platform. After the loading and offloading operation, Platform Crane Operators and supply vessel crews were moving the mini-containers to the starboard side of the vessel to keep clear the emergency laydown area on the boat deck. At 1413 hrs, while lifting the 2nd mini container, the vessel rolled to portside causing the lifted container to swing towards the centre line of the deck and the pallet of chemicals. The injured person then moved from his position on the forward side of the container to the inboard side in an attempt to arrest its movement. The container gained extra momentum and pushed the injured person against the pallet of chemicals. The injured person sustained a slight fracture to his 5th rib on the left-hand side.",HiPo Incident,790"A 14•À_•À_ high pressure header was isolated from the wells with all production going into the IP or LP parts of the system. All six of the 8•À_•À_ HP header inlet valves were closed. Each of these valves was fitted with a 1•À_•À_ bypass line and ball valve to allow for equalization to facilitate the opening of the valves when the wells need to be redirected. The ball valve was of a screwed body and connection type and the pipe-work was also connected using screwed fittings. The incident involved three of these 1•À_•À_ valves failing, two immediately and one a few moments later, with the body breaking apart at the screwed connection and the ball being ejected from the valve. This resulted in a significant gas release. The Production Operators made an immediate decision to shut down the gas plant.",HiPo Incident,791"An explosion occurred in an oily water drain sump during hot work to extend the height of the atmospheric vent line.

About 50 workers were working at this area. Some workers were on top of the cage structure, some were standing on planks supported on the cage wall at an intermediate height, while some were at the base of the cage on the Quay wall. At the same time a few steel-fixers were at the same location carrying out adjustment work to the steel cage and removing temporary supports. Unexpectedly, the re-bar cage slid and collapsed on the workers causing injury to 18 workers. A crane was used to lift some of the collapsed cage structure off the workers. A near by Medical emergency team was called. An ambulance arrived and the injured personnel were moved to Hospital for further treatment.",HiPo Incident,797"A hydraulic jack, that was being used to lift a 36"" gas line lost hydraulic pressure, failed. A 2nd jack of a different style was tried, but failed to lift the pipe sufficiently. The piping sup'r asked a crane operator to lift the pipe using an 80 tonne crane. The crane was brought into position and the lift attempted.  Shortly after commencing, the crane overload alarms sounded &amp; the operator manually overrode them. Eventually the crane boom deformed and failed, though it could have collapsed, resulting in fatalities of those working in the area.  The crane operator had no training on this type of crane, overrode safety critical devices, site procedures did not identify competency deficiences in operator, inadequate management of change, leadership and assessement of needs and risks.",HiPo Incident,799"During maintenance a 10_„ pipe end was left open. In this state a process shut down with flaring took place. This caused gas to flow through the open pipe end. The leak was not detected automatically because wind blowed the gas away. While flaring, the flame went out. A person was told to use a signal pistol to relight the flame and to shoot from a position in the area where gas was leaking out, not knowing about the leak. Being ready to shoot, he heard the gas leak. The leak was then stopped by closing a valve manually. The potential for material damage and personnel injury was high. Among main causes: Safety assessment prior to the maintenance job was insufficient - The maintenance operators believed they had blocked the free passage to the atmosphere,  but they had shut a wrong valve.",HiPo Incident,799"On 22nd September 2011, at approximately 11:30 Hrs, an inspection was planned to assess the integrity of BCDS heaters. The crew obtained a work permit and associated certificates to execute the task. There was no Task Risk Assessment (TRA) performed and there was no formal working procedure for the installation of burners of the heater. The heater was isolated and eight burners were removed. After inspection and repairs, the heater was being assembled for installation. Our labourers were using chain block to lift the burner. Vane blades of the burner were used as lifting lug and due to excessive tension/stress lead to slippage of the burner and the burner fell down on to the erected scaffolding. Outcome: Two labourers were struck by the falling burner and sustained minor facial injuries. ",HiPo Incident,799"While preparing installation of a X-mas tree a heavy object, a SUB weighing about 190 kilos, fell from the catwalk onto the drill floor and then through the mouse hole in the drill floor. The object continued to fall bout 14 meters down to a landing platform in the moonpool area where it hit a person working there. This person later died. Immediate causes were: Loose objects on the catwalk - Insufficient covering of the mouse hole - Poor communication between driller and deceased person. Underlying causes were:  A HAZOP for the lifting and installation of the X-mas tree had been carried out onshore, but the safety measures identified in the HAZOP were not implemented - A proper lifting and installation procedure had not been prepared - Weak safety awareness with both management and crew. ",HiPo Incident,799"Wireline crew were in the process of rigging down the lubricator as work had finished. The Wireline Crew consisted of a Wireline Winch Operative, a Senior Wireline Operator, a Wireline Assistant and a Platform Crane Operator. At the time of the incident the crew were ready to cut the wire to release the tool so they could wind the wire back on the drum. The Wireline assistant at this point took the decision to cut the wire on his own (at NO time was the operative in the worksite on his own), which as explained is a task completed by them on a regular basis. The process to follow was to grab hold of the wire running to the drum, move the wire close to the deck, place one leg of the wire cutters resting up against the deck and, with the person's free hand, operate the cutters to cut the wire.",HiPo Incident,801"Impairment of platform's HP flare system by filling with seawater:  One pair of bursting discs, protecting the shell side of a gas cooler, ruptured below set pressure while in service.  Seawater flowed through the bursting discs into the HP flare system.  Alarm did not activate. High level of water in the flare drum automatically initiated a production shutdown but not a depressurization. Seawater shutdown valve closed automatically, but did not prevent seawater being pumped into the gas cooler and on to the HP flare drum. Seawater pumps remained online. The HP flare drum and HP flare pipe work were filled with water before the source of the liquid was determined. The HP flare system was rendered unavailable for hydrocarbon blow down while full of seawater. Non-essential personnel were evacuated.  ",HiPo Incident,809"The port crane was being used to lift the anchor chain J-Hook from the supply vessel to its storage hang off point at the rig port aft. The injured person was banksman and 2 other men were handling the load. The injured person was standing between the storage post and rail in front of the port aft anchor winch area and was in visual contact with the C.O. The injured person signalled to lift up slightly so the shackle on the shank of the J-Hook could slide onto the hang off pin. However, the J-Hook shackle came up tight under the pin and cracked the weld on the underside and the pin bent upwards. The reactive force caused the hook to swing towards and against the injured person's torso, pushing him against the hand rail behind him. The C.O. moved the J-Hook away lifting and landing it on the riser deck.",HiPo Incident,813"Two members of the sites demolition team accidently cut into a 20 inch pipe containing gas at 1.7 barg. The pipe was cut on the wrong side of the isolation, the workscope having been misunderstood by the contractor. A site procedure relating to marking of pipes had not been followed. An estimated 162 kg of gas was released to the atmosphere. The gas was not ignited and was dispersed in an open area. There was no injury to personnel. The affected plant was shut down and depressured. At the time of the incident the 2 members of the demolition work party were positioned approximately 1m from the locus of the cut in a cherry picker basket. The 12v electrical control panel for the cherry picker located in a panel at the rear of the basket was not EX certified and so represented a potential source of ignition.",HiPo Incident,815"A temporary pump, driven by an internal combustion engine, was being used for an offloading operation from a gasoline road tanker onto a fuel tank on a production facility. This pump was positioned inside the bundwall. When the operation was almost completed, the operator (with 8 years experience) went to look for the supervisor to obtain his conformity. When the operator came back, the fuel tank was overflowing and spilling petrol inside the bundwall. The operator rushed to shut the valve. At that moment, the pump engine ignited the pool of petrol, causing 2nd degree burns to the operator and to the tanker driver. The speedy action of personnel allowed rapid extinction of the fire, which otherwise could have propagated through the production plant and a series of oil tanks, leading to a mayor catastrophe.",HiPo Incident,817"On 7th April 2010, in a Drilling rig, at around 03:45hrs, the rig crew was testing the BOP Blind Shear ram. After testing to 15,000 PSI, the night pusher bled the pressure back to the testing unit to zero and asked the floor man to close the manual valve next to the check valve. The IP was asked to disconnect the quick latch coupling of the test hose from the hammer union hook up to the lower kill line. While doing so, he slipped and the hose detached from the quick latch connection. As a result the fluid came out through the broken quick latch fitting of the hammer union like a jet and hit the right hand arm above the elbow. It appears that the pressure was not bled fully and there was trapped pressure behind the fitting. First Aid was administered to the IP, and he was taken to the hospital for further treatment.",HiPo Incident,826"During rig up operations, a critical lift was being performed to attach the 3.5 ton skid mounted derrick board to the derrick.  Two forklifts (one on drillers' side and one on pit side) used to raise the board appox 9"" off ground &amp; into position for pinning.  While attempting to intall pin on drillers' side, board slid off forks, overbalanced, &amp; tumbled 90 degrees towards catwalk.  This resulted in employee being thrown to the ground, with board coming to rest in an upright position, with derrick board frame surrounding employee. The crew failed to recognise this as a critical lift (use of 2 forklifts), there was no rig move plan nor JSA for the job task.  Leadership need to reinforce the lifting policy, evaluate all changes made to ensure a new unsafety condition is not introduced.  Reinforce ""Stop Work"" expectation.",HiPo Incident,837"The pilot positioned the helicopter for a west-southwest departure from an offshore platform due to prevailing wind conditions. After clearing the edge of the helideck, the helicopter started a slow yaw to the right. The pilot added full left pedal; however, this did not stop the rotation. After 360 degrees of rotation, the rotation quickened, the pilot stated that he ""didn't have a tail rotor,"" and lowered the collective and rolled the throttle to idle. The pilot deployed the emergency floats, and the helicopter impacted the water slightly nose low and in a right drift. The helicopter rolled over immediately to the right and stayed afloat. The pilot egressed the helicopter through the broken windscreen area, the left seat pilot egressed through the pilot's open door, and the passenger egressed through the left passenger door.",HiPo Incident,838"During de-rigging of coil rigdown operations, the coil tubing injector head was lifted from the lower frame section and placed on the drill floor, immediately in front of the V-door. The coiled tubing remained connected to the injector head. A winch outside the dog house was connected to the injector head to act as a snub line. The next step was to attach a threaded lifting cap to a 2nd winch to lift the BOP stack off the riser, and place it on its stand. At this point, there was slack line in the second winch. In an attempt to take up the slack line, the winch operator chose to operate the doghouse winch, thereby shifting the injector head instead of taking up the slack line. The force exerted by the winch on the injector head caused the injector head to fall over, roll and come to rest against a third winch on the drill floor.",HiPo Incident,840"A new piece of equipment (15 tonnes) was to be installed.  A lifting yoke was prefabricated with some of the required slings.  When lifting was to commence it was found that further slings were missing.  The drawing was requested from the vendor and sent to a lifting equipment specialist to fabricate the missing slings.  While the additional slings were being fabricated the already existing slings were fitted.  And when the additional slings were installed the cargo was lifted.  Immediately the yoke broke.  No personnel were injured.  Investigation showed that the slings were incorrectly fitted.  The installation drawing was insufficiently detailed and the slings not marked, nor were they controlled. The potential of the unwanted event was injury to personnel, possibly fatal.  The situation was caused by insufficient work planning.",HiPo Incident,843"The IP was involved in offloading a boat. A 45ft basket was taken off the boat. The basket was to be landed by the catwalk. The basket was spotted into position in the space available. While the basket was about to be fully landed out, the injured person positioned himself between some drill pipe and the edge of the catwalk. In this position, neither the crane op nor the 2nd roustabout could see him. As the basket was fully landed out, the weight pushed the pipes several inches towards the injured person. His foot was trapped between the outer joint of pipe and the wooden dunnage. The injured person fell back into the pipedeck, and his foot came out of his boot. The IP received medical attention at the rig hospital and was subsequently medivac'd to hospital where it was confirmed he had sustained broken bones to his lower left leg. ",HiPo Incident,844"On the 10th March a driller was working as a Banksman on guiding a cabin (heavy cargo) as it was being lowered into place on a platform. While the load was at four feet above the deck, i.e. one foot above the hand rail, it started to rotate counterclockwise. The Banksman who was standing on top of the stairway, told the crane operator to stop lowering the unit. Then he realised that the unit had swung across the top of the handrails, cutting off his escape route through the stairway. As he estimated that he could not escape below the load to reach the stairway, he sat on the handrails, and pushed himself backwards to extract his legs from the trap. He fell 4 metres backwards and hit his arm against a torque wrench lying on the deck when landing. The main injuries are fractured femur neck, deep cut on the right arm. LTI will be of 6 weeks.",HiPo Incident,850"An explosion occurred in a newly installed 400bbl H2O storagetank, throwing the roof 400 metres. 2 days before the incident, the tank underwent a purge using low flow sweet gas. The purge/blanket gas was then shut-in and the tank vented to a dedicated low-press flare.  Significant ambient temperature changes drew air into the tank. A high-press flare, located adjacent to the tank's dedicated low-pressure flare was flaring sweet gas when air/natural gas in the tank ignited. The flame front travelled through the tank's flare header to the tank and the roof blew off. No clear demarcation of construct and op controlled sites. Site significantly different from the standard well site set-up, but no site-specific written start-up or commissioning process.

During the risk assessment process it was noted by the work team the rope was terminated at the main hoist drum using a •À_Chinese finger•À_ or •À_sock•À_.  This has not been seen before as a termination method by members of the work team; a sock usually being used to haul a new rope onto a crane. Typical terminations used clamps or sockets and in these instances •À_industry practice•À_ is to also retain 3 wraps on the main hoist drum when fitting the come-along. These 3 wraps included the length of the termination sock. It was considered by the work team the sock would be capable of holding the weight of the rope being replaced and to attach the come-along when 3 wraps were left on the drum. ,HiPo Incident,851"During a routine check of a seismic vessel•À_s life boat deployment system, a chain securing the starboard life boat to a davit arm failed, putting the full weight of the lifeboat onto the other davit arm.  This caused the davit arm to fail with the result that the life boat fell from a height of approximately 6m into the sea. Initially the life boat was still attached to a painter line. The life boat was eventually recovered by a support vessel and taken under tow. The vessel had passed its annual safety equipment survey in Feb 2008.  Lifeboat falls etc were inspected at regular intervals and boats lowered every 2 weeks. The starboard life boat was last run in the water in Broome 4th March 2008.  The lifeboat falls were factory tested 19 March 2004 and fitted 06 April 2004.

The pumps were manually started.  Later a flange was observed releasing a spray of oil-mixed produced water from the new pipe system.  The gas detec-tors did not detect the oil, apparently due to high winds.  The pumps were stopped manually.  There was no oil released to the external environment and no personnel was hurt.  Investigation showed that the leak was caused by a broken pipe support (U-bolt).  The supporting of the pipe spool was not detailed or described in the construction material.  The running of the transfer/booster pumps was not described in a procedure.  The design of the separator weirs was not described in detail and need revisiting.

Part of the control system includes a fusible loop charged with nitrogen.  The nitrogen pressure had decayed and a team investigated.  The fault was traced to a pressure relief valve on the nitrogen system.  The relief path from this valve is directly into the enclosure.  During the investigation, 2 technicians entered the enclosure and were exposed to an oxygen deficient atmosphere due to the build up of the nitrogen venting into enclosure.  Both received medical attention &amp; have made a full recovery.  Poor design, as PSV relief placed within enclosure; plant upset caused vibration within enclosure which may have unseated PSV (set near bottom of spring range); lack of perceived threat from nitrogen, which causes rapid loss of consciousness and death,  leaking within a confined space.",HiPo Incident,904"During a test of the deluge system it was observed that it did not function in major parts of the platform.  Investigation showed that a new instrument tube had been incorrectly fitted to an open (not used) vent connection in a deluge skid, rendering the deluge skid inoperable.  The vent connection should have been fitted with a filter cap.  The installation drawing for the instrument tube was incomplete and did not specify the correct place of connection.  The operator had assumed the open (vent) port to be the best place for fitting the tube.  The potential of the event was that automatic release of the fire water would not have taken place in the case of a fire detected by the F&amp;G detection system.  Consequently, in case of fire, the fire water should have been manually released, hence at best causing a delay.  The event was caused by insufficient work planning and lack of supervision.",HiPo Incident,905"Contractor conducting hydrotest on 6000 foot section of newly installed 30"" horizontally drilled pipeline.

Maximum winds were less than 20 mph during planning of the days flight log. The platform received notification of extremely high winds in the vicinity and the pilot went up to properly secure the helicopter.  Prior to the pilot arriving, the wind had caught the helicopter broadside with enough force to push it against the heliport kick plate and tip it overboard into the ocean.  Wind across an 80+ mile wide line had increased to over 80 mph within a few minutes.  Other helicopter activities in the Gulf of Mexico were also impacted.  A helicopter based 80 miles away was also pushed overboard at nearly the same time during this unforecasted extreme weather event.

The release was due to a loss of containment at the cover of a 3•À_•À_ Y strainer on the water outlet line from the test separator. This occurred during a well test and the vessel was operating at approx 1220 psig. The loss of containment was due to the failure of the cover plate gasket. Failure of the gasket allowed the liquid level in the vessel to be lost and gas was subsequently released from the failed joint. A substantial gas cloud was seen after the crew was alerted by one of the installation•À_s fixed gas detectors, which alarmed at the 60% LFL high level and caused the platform to change status. The crew manually initiated an Emergency Shutdown (ESD) and the facility was made safe in accordance with the emergency response procedures in use. In the course of the response, the crew manually initiated the deluge in order to disperse the gas cloud.",HiPo Incident,954"A drilling barge rig was running casing on a well in 7700 feet of water.  After repositioning the barge, the crew was adjusting anchor lines to ""normal tension"" by paying out anchor line to decrease tension on it.  The winch operator did not follow the normal procedure by utilizing the dynamic brakes to pay out line but he instead used the band brakes (operator error).  Once the line started unreeling, the band brakes could slow but could not stop the anchor line, which completely unrolled.  Several pieces of equipment were damaged as the end of the rig anchor line whipped around before being pulled into the sea.  The barge listed about 4-1/2 degrees but was stabilized at 2-1/2 degrees before being ballasted to normal position.  There were no injuries.  This incident shows the importance of fail-safe mechanical design, improved visibility, improved operator ergonomics, improved training and the need for a hazard analysis of deepwater mooring operations.",HiPo Incident,967"The injured person was completing a disc change to the grinder he was using. The welder then tested the grinder to see if the wheel was secured and stable. The grinder was not in, or held facing in the correct position by the welder, it was laid on its back, wheel facing upright . The welder, by depressing the On/Off switch of the grinder (the safety button which is located on top of the grinder was also depressed, due to the weight of the grinder) lying on the table, the normal operation stated by the welder, of a quick on off action to the machine, was not possible as the safety button was activated. The welder had his left hand/arm on the table, the right hand activating the on/off switch. The kick that the grinder gives when activated and the motion of the grinder swung the grinder in the direction of the welder's left arm, thus catching him across the forearm with the disc.

The fast responder found doors near the affected building blown out of their frames and extinguished a small fire from the doorway using a 30# fire extinguisher before reporting to muster point. All power was cut off to the building and confirmed off before fire team entered the building. Initial physical inspection by fire team (with breathing apparatus in place) found no smoldering equipment or hot spots, but some strong fumes (no smoke) so they did not immediately enter the building until ventilation could be established.  Subsequent physical inspection of the area reveals significant damage inside the building with doors blown off electrical panels, damage to transformers, external building doors blown off hinges and building's AC unit damaged as well.",HiPo Incident,989"At 0705 hrs, a crewmember was hit by a 5 kg CO2 fixed fire extinguisher that accidently vented and injured the person's right leg and left foot.  The fire extinguisher cylinder had been transported with the fast rescue boat (FRB) from  support vessel and was stowed in the front compartment. On the way back to the rig, the FRB crew observed  that the bottle was leaking some carbon dioxide gas. Once the FRB was fully retrieved on board the rig at 0700 hrs, the bottle was carefully placed on deck for closer inspection.  The top was frozen and by now there was no visble sign of evaporating gas. It was noticed that the pin securing the lever was slightly bent. It was decided to release the remaining gas in order to empty the bottle completly for safety reasons. Crew not involved in the procedure were asked to leave the area and two crewmembers prepared to empty the cylinder. When the the pin was released the cylinder vented uncontrollably and hit one of the crewmembers on the lower leg.",HiPo Incident,996"During rigging down of a tender assisted drilling rig the derrick mast was picked up off the ""A"" frame and rest, swung around to the NE over the platform helideck towards the tender assist barge. During the time the mast was alongside the barge, the mast started to slip and fell on the hook 4 - 5ft, indicating that the brakes were not holding. As the crane operator swung the mast over the tender, the mast began to slip continuously until the trailing end of the mast settled on the poop deck. The mast was now diagonally across the deck from starboard to port and from stern to bow, with the crown section approximately 12ft above the main deck. At this stage an investigation was made and it was deduced that the brakes had failed. The rig mechanics began to remove the brake assembly that was assumed to be the problem. When the brake was levered out of the planetary gear the main drum was released and the mast fell onto the main deck. The hook of the crane came to rest inside the mast. ",HiPo Incident,996"Pulling out 3 •À__•À_•À_ EUE tubing was in progress at one of the Drilling Rig on 12th June 2011. The Driller sent a floor man on the man rider winch to the derrick board with a sledge hammer (approximately 10 lb) to release the elevator which was stuck. The floor man donned the man-riding safety harness with the hammer tied up with a rope to the front •À_D•À_ rings of safety harness. The hammer was placed between the straps of the harness while he ascended to the monkey board. During this activity four rig crew (3 floor man and the driller) were standing on the rotary and was installing the safety clamps on the tubing. When the floor man on the man riding winch moving closer to the elevator, the hammer slipped from the safety harness straps and fell down. Due to the impact of falling the hammer slid from the rope knot and fell from a height of approximately 90 f. One of the floor men was injured, as the hammer fell on his right shoulder. The IP sustained a fracture in the right scapula resulting in a lost workday case. ",HiPo Incident,1028"After drilling of the 16"" shallow gas phase, the 13 3/8"" casing got stuck 300m off the bottom; consequently, the drilling program was altered when the decision was taken to cement in place the 13 3/8"" casing and followed by well head contingency procedure including cold cutting. As a consequence a 23m stick-up of 13 3/8"" casing, full of mud, was standing above the wellhead which had to be cut following the successful cementing of the casing. It is supposed that thermal expansion due to heat (cement setting-up and formation temperature) caused over-pressure inside the casing. As a consequence it prematurely parted before being fully cut. The mud was projected, injuring the eyes of one of the technicians standing close by. The Weatherford Casing Over-Drive System (used to run casing) is equipped with valves which were left closed during the 19 hours prior to the cutting. These prevented mud inside casing from  venting as expected. It was the first time that cold cutting was performed with the Casing Over-drive System connected to the string.",HiPo Incident,1055"At approximately 0515 on 8 October 2006, saturation diving work was underway to replace damaged bolts on a 26•À_•À_ flange on the export gas pipeline. The work was being conducted at a depth of approximately 100 meters and was within the 500 meter zone of the platform. The operation was to lower a 2te tools basket, 2m x 2m, fitted with tag lines and •À_•À_light sticks•À_•À_ to the seabed. The load should be lowered to a safe vertical and horizontal location and then banked to the laydown area by the divers who can see the load. The target laydown area for the load was a 4m diameter exclusion zone from the location of the divers at the flange. However the closeness of this zone coupled with the hydrodynamic sway of the 2m square basket resulted in the load landing on top of one of the two divers in the water. The load was immediately raised and the diver was recovered first to the bell then to surface and then the decompression chamber where he was examined and treated by the medic.  The diver sustained back injuries in lower lumbar area. There was no evidence of internal injury.",HiPo Incident,1083"On 28 Oct, a CWP was issued by Network Operations allowing nitrogen purging from TFP BVS6 to TFP BVS7.  ICC #5001 was issued isolating BVS7 HOV706. The isolation was necessary to separate the nitrogen purging activity from the on-going line air drying activity from TFP-BVS7 to TFP-BVS8.  This information was made known through site check prior to the CWP issuance. On 29 Oct, the contractor started the 35 kms nitrogen purging activity venting at BVS7 HOV705 (2"" vent).  The contractor Commissioning Manager realizing that the purging will take a minimum of 3 days and with the nitrogen being used depleting (40,000 M3) coupled with it a probable air mixing scenario sought clearance from the PMT Commissioning Manager to open BVS7 HOV 711 (2"" vent) and the BVS7 12"" vent. The latter agreed to the request. BVS HOV711 and the BVS7 12"" vent was part of the air drying line that was isolated. On 1600H of 30 Oct, Network Operations, through a conversion inquiry with contractor Commissioning Manager, found out that the Isolation (Lock-Out) of BVS7 HOV706 was removed without their knowledge. ",HiPo Incident,1093"Upon completion of drilling the surface hole the crew was prepping to run 8 5/8"" casing. The driller (injured party) and rig manager had agreed to have the driller go on to the floor and assist the two short service employee floorhands with the first few joints. The rig manager moved over to the console to operate the rig while running the casing. The Rig Manager positioned the elevators over the box end of the first joint of casing, which was over 40 feet in length. The Driller ensured that the elevators were rigged up and he latched the elevators around the first joint and put the latching pin in place. The rig manager, operating the console began to pick up the first joint of casing from the pipe wrangler with the elevators. When the collar/box end of the joint of casing reached approximately 39 feet up the joint the collar/box end slipped through the latched elevators, falling back to the rig floor and slid down the pipe wrangler, coming to rest on the ground at the far end of the wrangler. During this event, the Driller was struck in the head sustaining multiple injuries.",HiPo Incident,1093"On the 25th November, 2008 at about 11:00 hours, a fit-up job and partial lamination was carried out on Line 4027 which was about 5 meters away from the drain pit. Resin and acetone chemicals were used for the job. At about 17:15 hours the lamination crew stopped working on Line 4025 and a crane was mobilized to site in order to carry out fit-up and alignment on the Tee-Spool of line 4027. As the crane position was too short for the lifting activity, and the gap was too wide for proper alignment of the pipes, the Piping Engineer stopped the work with the intention of continuing the following day. Therefore, the riggers released the crane, leaving the nylon web sling and shackles on the GRP line 4027. At about 17:45 hours, the riggers and fit-up crew left the worksite leaving only the crane operator behind. The crane operator left the site at about 17:48 hours and joined others to enter the staff bus which departed the worksite at, or about 17:53 hours. No one noticed abnormal situation up to that point in time. The generator, which was positioned few meters away from the  area, had earlier been switched off at about 17:50 hours.",HiPo Incident,1146"On 26th Feb. 2011 approximately at 22:00 hrs., after making up the 20"" casing head housing assembly to the 20"" casing string the casing string was picked-up with the 20 landing joint (P/Up weight = 550,000 lbs).  Circulation was established and the lowering of the 20"" casing string took place (Slack off weight = 535,000 lbs) aimed for landing the casing with the casing head housing at the landing ring.  After lowering the casing string (with housing) over a distance of 25 ft and with the casing head housing below rotary table whilst centring the casing head housing in the 30"" bell nipple, the landing joint disconnected from the 20"" casing string (stripped-out). The casing then fell down over the remaining distance of 35 ft. Until the casing head housing landed on the 30"" landing ring.  As a result of the disconnect of the landing joint, the full volume of the 20"" landing joint was released whilst still pumping. The pressure release and fluid release from the landings joint resulted in a high risk event because people were standing in the vicinity without expecting this to happen. The worst outcome from such an incident could have been a fatality.",HiPo Incident,1164"On 18 July 2009 a High Potential Near Miss incident occurred in a company villa which could have resulted in a fatality. An electric shock to the right arm was received by the resident from the cold water tap in the villa kitchen. An immediate initial investigation by an electrician revealed that all the villa•À_s water system-associated pipes and taps were live. No electrical system safety devices had operated. Further investigation revealed that a roof water pressure pump had overheated and caused melting of an internal capacitor. This had consequently made contact with the pump chassis which had then transferred current into the steel water pipes and associated equipment throughout the house.  Physical contact with the kitchen cold water tap had been just the lightest of touches. Had the resident got hold of the tap, the outcome could have been very different. In addition to establishing the failure of the water pump in question, the electrician found that the three water pumps comprising the system as a whole were not wired through the main property electrical system but through an external supply with no earthing and no circuit breaker protection.",HiPo Incident,1169"The incident occurred during the deployment of an acoustic array Apex mooring. A suspended load fell due to the failure of an acoustic release that was being used to lower the mooring into position. The failure occurred during the final lift for the deployment. The majority of the mooring was in the water suspended from the stopping chain. The final lift, to complete this deployment, consisted of a Current Meter, 1m chain, a float and the Oceano Acoustic Release. The Oceano release held the first part of the lift of approximately 156kg but as the full load of the mooring (approx 915kg) was taken up on the final lift, prior to the stopping chain being removed, the locking pin on the Oceano hook mechanism pulled out of the motor drive. This resulted in the suspended load falling to the deck. Part of the equipment which fell (float) struck a glancing blow to a crew members helmet. The vessel•À_s back deck sustained a 20cm x 7.5cm hole which was immediately repaired. The SWL of the Oceano release is 2.5T. There were 5 personnel involved in the back deck operations at the time of the incident. 4 of these people were in the immediate vicinity of the incident.",HiPo Incident,1170"Bb-230 is an oil producer which was handed over to Operations after work over, waiting for installation of surface facilities and flow line tie-in to RDS-3. After hand-over, Bb-230 was equipped with a new X-Mass Tree which did not have any identification / mark-up signs.  Bb-154 (Water injector) was killed and secured for work over and the work over was completed and well handed over to Operations.  It is approximately 6 km away from Bb-230 and contractor surveyors jointly prepared a well head survey sketch and wrongly identified Bb-230 (Oil Producer) as Bb-154 (Water Injector). The survey was endorsed by Operations. The contractor started the job on the wrong site location using approved PTW. He completed the whole job of excavation, installation of concrete supports, welding &amp; fabrication of the surface loop and finally was ready to loop tie-in to well head and flow line. Construction activities continued for 18 days without recognizing that the work execution was in the wrong location.  Later, the contractor requested another PTW for starting tie-in activities and operations foreman went to the site (Bb-230) and realized that the contractor is working on a wrongly identified well.",HiPo Incident,1206"A serious gas leak occured on an offshore production platform following a 4th stage gas compressor trip. 16 mill Sm3/day was sent to flare through the high pressure knock-out drum. A deflector plate installed in the drum below the HP discharge gave way, eventually blocking most of the gas outlet. The pressure build-up propagated backwards through the prosess causing rupture of a glas fibre reinforced plastic pipe at the seawater return from the 3rd level gas cooler. A gas leak was detected at the coolers. The pressure in the knock-out drum had now risen to 35 barg. Design pressure was 14 barg, and the tank was tested to 23,9 barg. 15 kg of the deflector plate was extruded and moved by the gas stream into the flare pipe. The metal accelerated some 12 meters before penetrating the pipe at the first 90•À__ bend, causing a 53x42 cm hole in the flare pipe. The pipe was made of 6MO, with diameter 600 mm and wall thickness 6 mm. A large, unignited gas leak followed. Production was shut down and plant depressuration was initiated. The damage potential was severe, but there were no injuries. All process and ESD barrieres, safety systems and other barriers operated according to design specifications.",HiPo Incident,1207"During a routine 3 year Inspection of the power boiler, the authorized Inspector (Contractor) had requested a hydrostatic test be conducted. The test pressure was established at 6205 kPa (1.5 times MAWP). The authorized Inspector communicated the required pressure to the operator using 2 different units of measure, (6205kPa and 900 psig) to ensure the test pressure was understood. The test was being conducted  in incremental steps of 300 psi for 5 minutes, 600 psi for 5 minutes and finally 900 psi for 1 hour. The test was conducted using 1 chart recorder with a calibrated ranged of 0 to 10000 kPa and a calibrated gauge with a range of 0 to 10 MPa to meet code requirements for test pressure between 25% to 67% of gauge range. The operator completed the pressure increase increments of 300, 600, and 900 reading the gauge as 3, 6, and 9. Not realizing the actual pressure increments were 3000 kPa, 6000 kPa, and 9000 kPa. The test was held for 1 hour successfully. However, ASME Section I boiler construction codes states that at no time can a hydro test pressure exceed 6% of test pressure or exceed 90% of material yield strength. Actual test pressure used was over 2 times the MAWP which over pressured the boiler.",HiPo Incident,1224"See you at 7:00 P.M. tonight Phoenix, Arizona! #MAGA
